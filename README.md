Object-oriented programming (English: object-oriented programming abbreviated as OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields or also known as attributes; and code, in the form of a function / procedure or also known as a method. All data and functions in this paradigm are wrapped in classes or objects. Compare with structured programming logic. Each object can receive messages, process data, and send messages to other objects,

Object-oriented data models are said to provide more flexibility, ease of customizing programs, and are widely used in large-scale software techniques. Furthermore, OOP proponents claim that OOP is easier to learn for beginners than previous approaches, and that the OOP approach is easier to develop and maintain.
